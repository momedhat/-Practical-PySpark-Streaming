# Practical PySpark Streaming
A Practical Structure Steaming Processing lab Using Pyspark. This project is intended for educational and demonstration purposes.
## Project Description:

This project demonstrates how to set up a practical stream processing lab using PySpark, a powerful and scalable data processing framework. Stream processing is a critical component of modern data engineering and analytics, enabling organizations to analyze and derive insights from real-time data as it flows into their systems. In this lab, we will create a PySpark DataFrame by reading a stream of data in CSV format, apply various operations to manipulate and analyze the data in real-time, and finally, write the results to an output stream.

## Project Components:

* **Data Ingestion:** We start by ingesting streaming data from a CSV source. PySpark's structured streaming API allows us to continuously read data from a specified source location.

* **Schema Definition:** A predefined schema is essential for structured streaming in PySpark. We will create a schema to define the structure of the incoming data.

* **Data Transformation:** Once the data is ingested, we will perform various data transformation operations on the DataFrame. This may include filtering, aggregating, and manipulating the data to derive meaningful insights.

* **Real-time Analysis**: PySpark provides powerful tools for real-time analysis. We will showcase how to perform computations and calculations on the streaming data, enabling you to gain insights as data arrives.

* **Output Stream:** After processing the data, we will write the results to an output stream. This could be a file sink, a database, or any other suitable destination.

## Technologies Used:

**PySpark**: PySpark is a Python library that provides a high-level API for distributed data processing using Apache Spark.

* **InputStream:** <br> This represents a continuous data source, likely a stream of CSV files containing stock data for the KOSPI index. These files are being updated and added to every second, which suggests real-time or near-real-time data ingestion.

* **OutputStream:** <br> This is where the processed data is being stored. It's mentioned that the data is stored as partitions, which suggests that PySpark is organizing the data into partitions for efficient storage and processing. <br> These partitions could be stored in a distributed file system like HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System) or a cloud-based storage system like AWS S3 or Azure Blob Storage.

* **CheckPoints:** <br> In PySpark, checkpoints are a mechanism used for fault tolerance and optimization. They allow you to save the state of a streaming application or a resilient distributed dataset (RDD) to a reliable distributed file system.
