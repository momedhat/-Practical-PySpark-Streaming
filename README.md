# Practical PySpark Streaming
A Practical Structure Steaming Processing lab Using Pyspark. This project is intended for educational and demonstration purposes.
## Project Description:

This project demonstrates how to set up a practical stream processing lab using PySpark, a powerful and scalable data processing framework. Stream processing is a critical component of modern data engineering and analytics, enabling organizations to analyze and derive insights from real-time data as it flows into their systems. In this lab, we will create a PySpark DataFrame by reading a stream of data in CSV format, apply various operations to manipulate and analyze the data in real-time, and finally, write the results to an output stream.

## Project Components:

* **Data Ingestion:** We start by ingesting streaming data from a CSV source. PySpark's structured streaming API allows us to continuously read data from a specified source location.

* **Schema Definition:** A predefined schema is essential for structured streaming in PySpark. We will create a schema to define the structure of the incoming data.

* **Data Transformation:** Once the data is ingested, we will perform various data transformation operations on the DataFrame. This may include filtering, aggregating, and manipulating the data to derive meaningful insights.

* **Real-time Analysis**: PySpark provides powerful tools for real-time analysis. We will showcase how to perform computations and calculations on the streaming data, enabling you to gain insights as data arrives.

* **Output Stream:** After processing the data, we will write the results to an output stream. This could be a file sink, a database, or any other suitable destination.

## Technologies Used:

**PySpark**: PySpark is a Python library that provides a high-level API for distributed data processing using Apache Spark.
